Come, O servant of the Light! A star shall lead the people and the darkness shall be abated. The time of darkness meets the dawn. The desolate throne shall again be filled.

Create the bonds and lead the Light. Thy sacrifice shall free us. O Come O servant of the Light! The time of darkness meets the dawn. The empty thrown shall be filled!



The rise of the Light shall shine against the Dark, for the final time. 

The Man of Good shall die alone and without friends, defeated by his enemies. All shall sorrow and wail at his passing. The last of their hope disappearing.

By Gifts and Power of that Great Spirit, who's eyes watch all, the Servants shall oppose the Last Veranite! Their powers great, the Last Veranite shall fall! He shall fall! And none can deliver him! The Servants shall rise to defeat him!
